## 1. Requirements
### 1.1 User Stories
1. *As a patient*, I want to securely connect my healthcare devices to the platform so that I can monitor my health data in real time.  
2. *As a healthcare provider*, I want to access patient data remotely so that I can provide timely recommendations and interventions.  
3. *As a healthcare organization*, I want a system that ensures interoperability between different devices so that patient data flows seamlessly.  
4. *As a device manufacturer*, I want the platform to support multiple data formats so that integration with existing devices is feasible.  

### 1.2 Use Cases
- **UC1**: A patient connects a glucose monitor to the platform.  
- **UC2**: A healthcare provider receives an alert for a patient's abnormal vital signs.  
- **UC3**: A device-to-device communication event synchronizes data across multiple devices.  
- **UC4**: A healthcare organization monitors system uptime and security compliance.  

### 1.3 Features
- **Device Data Integration**: Real-time data collection from healthcare devices.  
- **Distributed Data Management**: Ensuring real-time synchronization and fault tolerance.  
- **Device-to-Device Communication**: Secure interoperability across devices.  
- **Patient Dashboard**: Actionable insights, visualizations, and alerts.  
- **Provider Dashboard**: Real-time patient monitoring and trend analysis.  
- **Two-Way Communication**: Secure messaging and video consultations.  
- **Educational Resources**: Patient education on chronic condition management.  
- **Scalability and Security**: Compliance with healthcare data regulations.  

### 1.4 Gherkin Validation
- **Scenario: Patient connects a healthcare device**
  - **Given** a registered patient has a compatible healthcare device,
  - **When** they pair the device with the platform,
  - **Then** the system should securely store and display real-time data.

- **Scenario: Provider receives an alert**
  - **Given** a patient’s health metrics exceed a critical threshold,
  - **When** the system detects abnormal values,
  - **Then** an alert is sent to the assigned healthcare provider.

- **Scenario: Device-to-Device Communication**
  - **Given** multiple healthcare devices are connected to the platform,
  - **When** data synchronization is required,
  - **Then** the system ensures secure and real-time data exchange between devices.

- **Scenario: Secure Data Transmission**
  - **Given** a healthcare device is actively transmitting data,
  - **When** the platform processes incoming health metrics,
  - **Then** the data should be encrypted and securely stored in compliance with regulations.

- **Scenario: Authentication and Compliance**
  - **Given** a user attempts to access patient data,
  - **When** authentication is required,
  - **Then** the system should verify credentials and log the access attempt.
