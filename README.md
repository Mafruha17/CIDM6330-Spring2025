## 📖 Design Evolution and Real-World Projection Overview

The original system design, created during Evolution 0, focused on enabling secure healthcare device communication, real-time data integration, and enhancing patient-provider interaction. As the project evolved through Evolutions 1 to 5, it became clear that delivering a robust distributed healthcare platform would require expanding beyond the initial scope.

To meet the growing complexity, additional architectural elements — such as asynchronous task handling via Celery, real-time messaging through Redis, and containerized deployment using Docker — were incorporated. These enhancements addressed critical needs like scalability, resilience, and distributed processing, which are essential for real-world systems but were not part of the early conceptual diagrams.

It is important to note that while the system has been fully implemented within an academic context, it has not yet been tested in a live industry environment. However, the architecture is deliberately designed with scalability and extensibility in mind. With planned scope expansion, realistic project planning, allocation of appropriate technical resources, and industry validation, the system could feasibly be matured into a production-grade healthcare communication platform.

This project demonstrates that thoughtful early-stage architecture, combined with iterative expansion and strategic resource planning, can bridge the gap between academic prototypes and real-world software delivery.

## 📘 Gherkin BDD Scenarios

### Feature: Patient Management

**Scenario: Successfully Create a New Patient**
```gherkin
Given the user provides valid patient information
When the user submits a create patient request
Then the system should store the patient and return a success response
```

**Scenario: Update an Existing Patient's Information**
```gherkin
Given a patient already exists in the system
When the user updates the patient's details
Then the system should reflect the updated information
```

### Feature: Provider Management

**Scenario: Assign a Provider to a Patient**
```gherkin
Given both a patient and a provider exist
When the user assigns the provider to the patient
Then the system should link the provider to the patient without creating duplicates
```

**Scenario: List All Patients Under a Provider**
```gherkin
Given a provider has multiple patients assigned
When the user requests the list of patients for that provider
Then the system should return all linked patients
```

### Feature: Device Management

**Scenario: Assign a Device to a Patient**
```gherkin
Given a device exists and a patient exists
When the user assigns the device to the patient
Then the system should update the device to reference the correct patient
```

**Scenario: Unassign a Device from a Patient**
```gherkin
Given a device is currently assigned to a patient
When the user unassigns the device
Then the system should remove the patient reference but retain the device
```

### Feature: Event Notification

**Scenario: Trigger a Notification on New Patient Creation**
```gherkin
Given a new patient is successfully created
When the patient is saved in the database
Then the system should asynchronously trigger a notification task using Celery
```

---

## 🔢 TDD Mapping: Unit Tests Correspondence

| Gherkin Scenario | Unit Test File | Test Method |
|:-----------------|:--------------|:------------|
| Create Patient | test_patient.py | `test_create_patient` |
| Update Patient | test_patient.py | `test_update_patient` |
| Assign Provider | test_provider.py | `test_assign_provider` |
| List Patients for Provider | test_provider.py | `test_list_patients_for_provider` |
| Assign/Unassign Device | test_device.py | `test_assign_and_unassign_device` |
| Trigger Notification | test_api.py | `test_patient_creation_triggers_task` |

Each Gherkin BDD feature is backed by corresponding Django unittest methods in the `mainapp/tests/` directory.
